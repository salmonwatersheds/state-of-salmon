## state-of-salmon

### Overview

This repo contains code and data used to estimate time series of spawner
abundance for each species and region as part of PSF’s State of Salmon
reporting.

### Files

- `code` contains R code to expand spawner abundance from river-level
  estimates to regional indices used in State of Salmon reporting.
- `data` has original data or links to these data when sources are
  publicly available elsewhere.
- `output` contains processed data and summaries that are usually
  produced by R code in `code` and used in plotting.

### Acknowledgements

Code here is written by Steph Peacock and Eric Hertz. PSF’s State of
Salmon reporting is led by Eileen Jones and funded by the [Pacific
Salmon Foundation](www.psf.ca).
